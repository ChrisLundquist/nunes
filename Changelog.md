# 0.2.0

## Backwards Compatibility Break

* No longer using the inflector to pretty up metric names. This means that when you upgrade from 0.1 and 0.2 some metrics will change names.
* Namespaced several of the stats to make them easier to graph.

## Fixed

* Instrumenting namespaced controllers

# 0.1.0

* Initial release.
